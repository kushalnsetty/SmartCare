        Privacy Policy for Healthy Horizons Clinic Website
        Effective Date: April 11, 2025
        
        Healthy Horizons Clinic (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website (the “Website”) or use our services, including appointment scheduling and patient portals. This policy complies with applicable laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Please read it carefully.
        
        1. Information We Collect
        We collect the following types of information:
        
        Personal Information: Name, email address, phone number, mailing address (e.g., when you fill out contact forms or book appointments).
        Protected Health Information (PHI): Medical history, appointment details, insurance information, or other health-related data submitted via the patient portal or forms.
        Technical Data: IP address, browser type, device details, and cookies (to improve Website functionality and analyze usage).
        We collect this information directly from you (e.g., through forms), automatically (e.g., via cookies), or from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers with your consent).
        
        2. How We Use Your Information
        We use your information to:
        
        Provide healthcare services, such as scheduling appointments or managing patient records.
        Communicate with you, including sending appointment reminders or responding to inquiries.
        Improve the Website through analytics (e.g., tracking site usage patterns).
        Comply with legal obligations, such as reporting to public health authorities.
        For PHI, we use and disclose information only as permitted by HIPAA, such as for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
        3. How We Share Your Information
        We may share your information:
        
        With healthcare providers, staff, or business associates (e.g., labs) for treatment or operational purposes, under HIPAA-compliant agreements.
        With third-party service providers (e.g., website hosting, payment processors) who are bound by confidentiality obligations.
        As required by law, such as in response to subpoenas or public health mandates.
        We do not sell your information or share PHI for marketing without your explicit consent.
        4. Cookies and Tracking
        We use cookies to enhance your experience, such as remembering preferences or analyzing site traffic. You can manage cookies through your browser settings or our cookie consent tool (if applicable). We use third-party tools like Google Analytics, which may collect anonymized data. See their privacy policies for details.
        
        5. Data Security
        We implement reasonable safeguards, including encryption, secure servers, and access controls, to protect your information. For PHI, we follow HIPAA security standards. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access.
        
        6. Your Rights
        Under HIPAA, you have the right to:
        
        Access, amend, or request restrictions on your PHI.
        Request an accounting of certain disclosures.
        File a complaint if you believe your privacy rights have been violated.
        If applicable (e.g., under GDPR or CCPA), you may also request to access, delete, or limit the use of your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below.
        7. Data Retention
        We retain personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described above or as required by law. PHI is kept per HIPAA and state retention rules (e.g., 7 years for medical records). Data no longer needed is securely deleted.
        
        8. Third-Party Services
        The Website may link to third-party platforms, such as payment gateways or telehealth providers. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
        
        9. Updates to This Policy
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page with a new effective date. For significant changes, we may notify you via email or a Website notice.
